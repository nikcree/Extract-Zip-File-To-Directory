To extract .zip files on hosts that do not have a cPanel nor uncompress facility (e.g. Webcity, GoDaddy)
=========================================================================

1. Upload this file to the root directory of your web hosting.
2. Replace "filename" with the name of the file to be extracted.
3. Replace "/destination/dir" with the name of the directory where the files are to be extracted to (Note: this will overwrite files in that directory with the same name)
5. Navigate to the file in the browser (e.g. http://domain.com/extract.php).
6. The file will be extracted.
